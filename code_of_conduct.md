We respect the right of each member to have such an experience, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, country of origin, economic status, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes making comments in any form that cause offense on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, country of origin, economic status, or religion. It also includes posting sexual images in public or private spaces, deliberately attempting to intimidate someone, stalking someone virtually or otherwise, and engaging in other forms of beahavior that clearly violate norms of acceptable, non-harmful behavior in a professional setting. If told to do so by rmotr staff, any member that has committed harassment is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, staff members may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the bootcamp with no refund.
