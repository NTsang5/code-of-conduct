_This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)‚Äù._

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. RMOTR staff is prepared to handle any incident that violates the [code of conduct policy](https://github.com/rmotr/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) and knows how to handle any type of harassment. 

2\. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to any RMOTR staff member. All reports
are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have
had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection
as it is the other students.

When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available but do not
interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (name, slack or github username) of the student doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they will not be tolerated. In many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. RMOTR staff requests that they be your first resource when reporting any incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.
